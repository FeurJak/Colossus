//! Access Control Module
//!
//! This module provides capability-based access control with privacy-preserving
//! blinded attributes. The authority never sees actual attribute values, only
//! Poseidon2 commitments verified through Falcon512 signatures.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The access control system consists of:
//!
//! - **Capability Authority**: Issues and manages access capabilities using blinded mode
//! - **Access Capabilities**: Tokens that grant access to protected resources
//! - **Blinded Attributes**: Privacy-preserving attribute commitments
//! - **Encrypted Headers**: Encrypted metadata attached to protected content
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```
//! use colossus_core::access_control::{AccessControl, CapabilityAuthority};
//!
//! // Create an access control instance
//! let ac = AccessControl::default();
//!
//! // Setup a capability authority with blinded mode
//! let mut auth = ac.setup_blinded_authority().expect("setup failed");
//! auth = auth.with_identity();
//! auth.init_blinded_structure().expect("init failed");
//!
//! // Register issuers and grant capabilities based on blinded claims
//! // See test/access_control.rs for complete examples
//! ```
//!
//! # Security Model
//!
//! - All attributes are stored as Poseidon2 commitments (authority never sees values)
//! - Issuers vouch for attributes through Falcon512 post-quantum signatures
//! - Same attributes can have different commitments (unlinkable)
//! - Tracing capabilities allow auditing without compromising anonymity

///
/// `AccessControl` provides a thread-safe interface for managing capability-based
/// access control. It wraps a cryptographically secure random number generator
/// and provides methods for:
///
/// - Setting up capability authorities
/// - Granting access capabilities
/// - Encrypting and decrypting content with access policies
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// All methods are thread-safe. The internal RNG is protected by a mutex.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use colossus_core::access_control::AccessControl;
///
/// let ac = AccessControl::default();
/// let mut auth = ac.setup_blinded_authority().expect("setup failed");
/// auth = auth.with_identity();
/// auth.init_blinded_structure().expect("init failed");
/// ```
